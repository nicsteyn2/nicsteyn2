## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a doctoral student on the [Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning CDT](https://statml.io) at the University of Oxford, supervised by Professor Christl Donnelly and Dr Kris V Parag.

Currently I'm working on: 
 - SMC methods for epidemic renewal models ([website](https://nicsteyn2.github.io/SMCforRt/)/[preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.18875)/[GitHub repo](https://github.com/nicsteyn2/SMCforRt))
 - Uncertainty quantification in epidemic models ([article](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaf165)/[GitHub repo](https://github.com/nicsteyn2/RobustRtEstimators)/[vignettes](https://nicsteyn2.github.io/RobustRtEstimators/))
 - Smoothing methods for epidemic survey data ([preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.04.16.25325936)/[GitHub repo](https://github.com/nicsteyn2/EpidemicSurveySmoothing/tree/main)/[vignettes](https://github.com/nicsteyn2/EpidemicSurveySmoothing/tree/main/examples))
 - A descriptive analysis of behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in England ([preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.03.25323250)/[data portal](https://m-whit-ic.shinyapps.io/react-social-shiny/))
 - Estimating orphanhood due to COVID-19 and all-causes in Brazil, extending [previous work](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/orphanhood_calculator/#/country/Brazil) with higher quality data and more rigorous methodology ([preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.31.25321479)/[GitHub repo](https://github.com/MLGlobalHealth/BrazilOrphanhood))

I do most of my work in Julia, although I am also highly proficient in R, proficient in MATLAB, and I once knew Python, C++, and SQL.

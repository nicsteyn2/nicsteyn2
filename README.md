## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a doctoral student on the [Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning CDT](https://statml.io) at the University of Oxford, supervised by Professor Christl Donnelly and Dr Kris V Parag.

Currently I'm working on: 
 - SMC methods for epidemic renewal models ([website](https://nicsteyn2.github.io/SMCforRt/)/[working paper](https://github.com/nicsteyn2/SMCforRt/blob/main/workingpaper.pdf)/[GitHub repo](https://github.com/nicsteyn2/SMCforRt))
 - Uncertainty quantification in epidemic models ([preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.22.24315918)/[GitHub repo](https://github.com/nicsteyn2/RobustRtEstimators)/[vignettes](https://nicsteyn2.github.io/RobustRtEstimators/))
 - Smoothing methods for epidemic survey data
 - A descriptive analysis of behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in England
 - Estimating orphanhood due to COVID-19 and all-causes in Brazil, extending [previous work](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/orphanhood_calculator/#/country/Brazil) with higher quality data and more rigorous methodology

I do most of my work in Julia, although I am also highly proficient in R, proficient in MATLAB and Python, and I once knew C++ and SQL.
